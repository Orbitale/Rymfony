# v0.3.1

* Add a "healthcheck" system to restart php-fpm/php-cgi when it fails.
* Disable "native php" server support (it's not customizable, slow, not cgi, so we don't recommend it anyway).
* Tidy the different config/project paths properly, and enhance some error messages for better debugging.
* Tidy the PIDs management so that they're easier to discover and manage.

# v0.3.0

* Embed Caddy server into Rymfony, instead of using Warp (by @Pierstoval in https://github.com/Orbitale/Rymfony/pull/85)

# v0.2.3

* Allow to run php-fpm (and by extension Rymfony itself) as root by @Shine-neko in #86

* Fis compatibility with MacOS Big Sur

# v0.2.1
