If you want to contribute, you can clone the project directly on your machine, you'll need to have Rust installed, with your native toolchain.

If you don't want to clone the repo or setup Rust by yourself, you can open the project on Gitpod by clicking this button:<br>
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Orbitale/Rymfony)

All the necessary tools are already installed (Git, Rust and PHP) in the online workspace, and you have an online IDE named Theia, which is really close to VSCode.

Rymfony has to be available in several different environments (native Windows, WSL1, WSL2, Debian-based architectures, Mac OS, and other architectures where PHP can be executed).<br>
Then, it will be **very useful** if you have different environments too, even when using VMs.

For all other questions, feel free to [submit an issue to talk about the development workflow](https://github.com/Orbitale/Rymfony/issues/new)
